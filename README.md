# The Godzilliqa Limited NFT series
![Giant Monster](https://github.com/csajedi/GodzilliqaLTD/blob/main/godz.jpeg)

The goal of this series is to put money in the hands of artists. Each month will identify artists with an interest in monsters or Zilliqa and comission a work of art building on the Godzilliqa myth for sale as a single-item collectible. Over the course of the following months the audio and visual renditions will begin to agree, and in a decentralized manner shape a valuable brand asset that can be reused as a symbol of the Zilliqa project.

# Benefit

By using a customized NFT auctioneer contract we can begin the Auction with [Godzilliqa#001](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc6qQbGuLdJyqTVSDU2FhRiZqshnagL9NpT2tn2qCvhJP) today. The first NFT in the series will be auctioned off with the allocation 100% to benefit the artists. This is to send a strong message and hopefully attract artists with an intrinsic motivation to the project. Future NFTs may also allocate a portion of their sale price to go towards buying and burning carbon offsets on behalf of the network's PoW carbon footprint.

# First round

This round the contracts are already on the testnet and the media is on IPFS. Once we find a suitable partner to market the auction and host the frontend we will begin the sale. We have already begun talking with Okimoto about hosting the series going forward. Credit to Michael Mills for the musical work and Emma Gallagher for the visual art of Godzilliqa#001.
